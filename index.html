            Ngee Ann Polytechnic and am ready to explore and venture deeper into the world of Information Technology. Passionate about programming, I am willing
            to learn new skills and to proficiently use my existing skills at disposal. I truly am excited to see what my future will hold for me in the Information 
            Technology sector.

                As part of my class's Values In Action Project(VIA), we went down to GoodLife! Makan to entertain and spend time with the elderly. We played many board games such as chess
                and checkers. We also played traditional games such as Five Stones. We also conducted musical performances and even made mooncake for them. It truly was a good experience
                and the happiness and joy I felt from the elderly is something I will never forget.

                not to judge other based on stereotypes, learnt to be more grateful in life, and learnt the importance and reasons for having these care centres in Singapore. I also managed
                to learn and practise values such as good time management, effecive communication and teamwork, and having respect and patience.

                the I had a great time teaching the elderly.

            <h2>How Zoom Secures the Infrastructure That Powers the World with Okta ASA</h2>
            <p>
                This webinar is about zoom, which is a popular tool that is used for online communication. It explains how Zoom managed to handle their quick growth in popularity in
                areas such as security and usage. I chose to attend this webinar because I feel that zoom is an application that is very relevant to me now and is an application that
                I would most likely need to use in the future. It is also gaining huge popularity and is used in alot of aspects in our life.This seminar has taught me the benefits and
                importance of using a cloud server and why we should switch from on-premise solution to a cloud-based solution. It has also taught me that there are times where companies
                need to source out third-party companies to handle security and to help make them more efficient. This seminar also taught me cyber security concepts such as proper identity
                Access Management, importance of having proper management of SSH keys, and having proper staff offboarding and onboarding procedure.

            <h2>Fighting Fraud Without Friction</h2>
            <p>
                This webinar is about fighting fraud online. This webinar shares and teaches about the main threats businesses face today and how to handle them. It provides insights on the
                tools used by attackers. I decided to go for this industry online talk because the talk was about online frauds which is an area that is very close and relevant to what I am
                currently studying. Cyber frauds really are very common around the world and many businesses face this attack. Cyber frauds can result in the loss of huge amounts of money and
                loss of personal information. I have learnt the need to have a good user interface and the importance of finding a balance of good security and good user experience.

            <h2>VeraTalks: What Holds Developers Back From Addressing Security Vulnerabilities</h2>
            <p>
                This seminar talks about security vulnerabilities found in applications. It discusses the common misconceptions around open source flaws and shows how easy it is to find and
                fix library flaws.I decided to go for this seminar because software vulnerabilities are something that is very relevant and important for me. No system or software or application
                is 100% secure and there will always be vulnerabilities identified. I have learnt that one of the best way to prevent attackers from exploiting these exploits is to always ensure
                that these applications, softwares and systems are updated and at their latest version.

            <p>
                This webinar talks about ransomware which is a dangerous cyber security attack. It covers areas such as the dangers of ransomware in the retail industry and how we can mitigate
                and avoid such attacks. I wanted to go for this webinar because this webinar talks about ransomware which is one of the most dangerous cyber threats in the world now. Ransomware
                is an attack that causes huge negative impacts on a business such as losing a huge sum of money, losing important data, and losing its reputation. This seminar has highlighted the
                importance of having security features installed and maintained in an organization, as well as extend of the impact a Ransomware attack can have.
